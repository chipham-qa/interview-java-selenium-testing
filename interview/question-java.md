**Question 1: How to create a constructor in java?**

-> Answer:  A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created.
    It is used to initialize the object's state.
    The constructor has the same name as the class and has no return type (not even void).

**Question 2: The constructor is static or non-static?**
 
 -> Answer: A constructor can be either static or non-static.
    A non-static constructor is used to create instances of an object and initialize their state.
    It is automatically called when you create an object of the class using the new operator.

 -> A static constructor, on the other hand, is used to initialize the class itself.
    It is called once when the class is loaded into memory and is commonly used to perform one-time setup tasks for the class,
    such as initializing static fields or creating resources that are shared by all instances of the class.

 **Question 3: What is the different between method overloading and constructor overloading?**
  -> Answer: In summary, method overloading is used to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while constructor overloading is used to define multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

 **Question 4: What is the different between overloading and overloading?**
 -> Answer: In summary, method overloading allows defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

  **Question 5: What is the use of final keywork?**

-> Answer:  the final keyword is used in Java to indicate that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified once it has been declared or defined. This can be useful to prevent accidental changes or to ensure the integrity of critical components in a program
 
  **Question 6: What is the difference between final and finally?**
 -> Answer: In summary, final is a keyword that is used to declare a variable, method or class that cannot be modified, while finally is a keyword that is used in a try-catch-finally block to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not
