Question 1: How to create a constructor in java?
 -> Answer:  A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created.
    It is used to initialize the object's state.
    The constructor has the same name as the class and has no return type (not even void).

 Question 2: The constructor is static or non-static?
 -> Answer: A constructor can be either static or non-static.
    A non-static constructor is used to create instances of an object and initialize their state.
    It is automatically called when you create an object of the class using the new operator.

    A static constructor, on the other hand, is used to initialize the class itself.
    It is called once when the class is loaded into memory and is commonly used to perform one-time setup tasks for the class,
    such as initializing static fields or creating resources that are shared by all instances of the class.
